# Visual Representation of Presidential Influence on the Supreme Court
This is an ongoing attempt at visually representing presidential influence on the Supreme Court, as defined by justice tenure. This representation chooses the "Modern Era" as the post-FDR era for historical and demographic reasons.

Data will be scrapped from the SCOTUS wikipedia page for now, or until I find a more robust data source.
Follow-on additions to this project will include exploring the frequency of landmark cases in relation to the Chief Justice and the President who appointed him.

I'll be updating the project more frequently given the recent death of Justice Scalia.
